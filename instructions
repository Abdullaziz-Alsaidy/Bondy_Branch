You already have access to the Android project Bondy Branch (com.bondy.branch).
This app is part of a loyalty SaaS system for coffee shops and branches.

Here’s the project idea and what to build:

🏪 Bondy Branch App — Overview

The app is used by branch staff (cashiers or baristas) to manage loyalty card transactions for customers.
Each customer has a digital loyalty card with a cups count (e.g., 8 cups = 1 free reward).

🎯 Goal

Build the branch-side app that:

Lets branch users log in (fake login, store token locally).

Lets them scan a QR or manually enter a card number.

Fetches and displays the customer’s loyalty card info (cups filled, goal, redeemed count).

Allows SALE (add cups) and REDEEM (reset cups when goal reached).

Shows today’s stats (total sales, redemptions) on a dashboard.

Keeps a local transaction history (using Room or in-memory).

Has a simple settings screen (environment switch + logout).

🧩 Technical details

Architecture: MVVM + Jetpack Compose + Hilt + Coroutines + Flow + Retrofit + Room

Fake API (simulate remote calls through FakeRemoteDataSource):

/login

/getCard/{cardNumber}

/processSale

/processRedeem

Use a NetworkResult sealed class (Success, Error, Loading)

Use simple data models:

data class LoyaltyCard(
    val id: String,
    val cupsFilled: Int,
    val cupsGoal: Int,
    val redeemedCount: Int,
    val lastActivity: String
)

enum class TransactionType { SALE, REDEEM }

@Serializable
data class Transaction(
    val id: Int,
    val userId: Int,
    val brandId: Int,
    val branchId: Int? = null,
    val cardId: Int,
    val transactionType: TransactionType, // SALE or REDEEM
    val source: TransactionSource,         // POS or APP_MANUAL
    val integrationType: IntegrationType? = null, // foodics / marn if POS
    val cupsCount: Int = 0,                // cups in this transaction
    val cupsFilled: Int = 0,               // updated cups_filled after processing
    val redeemedCount: Int = 0,            // updated redeemed cups
    val rewardsEarned: Int = 0,            // number of rewards from this transaction
    val carryOver: Int = 0,                // remaining cups after reward
    val totalCupsGoal: Int = 0,            // cups_goal from Brand rule
    val status: TransactionStatus = TransactionStatus.PROCESSED,
    val createdAt: Date? = null,
    val lastActivity: Date? = null,
    val message: String? = null             // API message e.g. "Reward earned!"
)


@Serializable
data class Brand(
    val id: Int,
    val name: String,
    val logo: String,
    val branches: List<Int> = emptyList(),
    val subStatus: String? = null,
    val subTier: String? = null,
    val cardDesign: Map<String, Any>? = null, // JSON-like structure
    val rule: Map<String, Any>? = null,       // JSON-like structure
    val soldCups: Int = 0,
    val redeemedCups: Int = 0,
    val users: List<Int> = emptyList(),
    val lastPayment: Date? = null,
    val welcomingMessage: String? = null
)

@Serializable
data class Branch(
    val id: Int,
    val location: String,
    val brandId: Int,
    val foodics: Boolean = false,
    val marn: Boolean = false,
    val manual: Boolean = false,
    val soldCups: Int = 0,
    val redeemedCups: Int = 0
)

Reward logic:

SALE → add cups; if total >= goal → increment redeemedCount.

REDEEM → reset cupsFilled to 0.

🧭 How to proceed

Start by generating a project plan (list the steps: data layer → use cases → UI screens).

Then create the data models + repository layer (Retrofit interface, FakeRemoteDataSource, BondyRepository).

Then move to the ViewModels and UI Composables (Login → Dashboard → Scan → Card Details → History → Settings).

Keep each step self-contained — show which files you edit and full code for them.

Use Compose Material3 and Navigation-Compose for screen navigation.

Important:

The API is fake for now; don’t name anything “Mock.”

Keep code production-quality and concise.

Use Kotlin DSL Gradle.

The app already exists — do not recreate it, just add features step-by-step according to this plan.

✅ Task 1 for you now:

Create the development plan and folder/file roadmap for the Bondy Branch app based on the above description, then start implementing step 1.
